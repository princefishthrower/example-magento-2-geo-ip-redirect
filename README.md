# Example Magento 2 Geo IP Redirect Code

This is example code to get you started with dynamically setting the store context based on your customers' locations.

See the [detailed blog post about this code here.](https://chrisfrew.in/blog/magento-2-geo-ip-redirect-using-ipstack/)

Note that it follows the standard Magento `YourCompany\YourModule` pattern, and folder / php files are named accordingly.

To use this code in its exact form, you will need to sign up for an ipstack account [here](https://ipstack.com/product) and replace the `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` placeholder with your real API key. However, the code is easy enough to interchange with any geo IP API of your choice.
